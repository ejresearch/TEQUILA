Welcome to the first day of Latin A!
Students are introduced to Latin as the Church’s language of faith and peace.
They learn how Latin sounds, sing the alphabet chant, and practice greetings and first words (salve, vale, pax, Deus, rosa).
Through demonstration and guided discovery, they understand that nouns are “naming words.”
The class ends with a simple faith phrase—Pax vobiscum (peace be with you)—and a reflection on how learning language begins with Fides – Faith.
