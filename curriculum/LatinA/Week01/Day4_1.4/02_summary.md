Students complete their first week of Latin by reviewing vocabulary, chanting endings, and demonstrating mastery of -a / -am through a fun quiz.
They translate simple Latin sentences aloud, identify subjects and objects, and review their faith phrase Pax vobiscum.
The lesson ends in reflection and gratitude—celebrating that learning Latin in order and peace mirrors God’s orderly creation.
Virtue focus transitions from Fides (Faith) to Pax (Peace), completing the week’s spiritual arc.
