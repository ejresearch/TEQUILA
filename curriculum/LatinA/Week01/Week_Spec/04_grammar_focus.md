### Introduction to the Latin Alphabet and Sounds

The Latin alphabet is the foundation of our study. It consists of 23 letters, each with its unique sound. Unlike English, Latin pronunciation is consistent, making it easier to learn once the basic sounds are mastered.

To begin, we focus on the vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Each vowel has a long and short sound. For example, 'A' is pronounced as /aÀê/ in 'aqua' (water).

Consonants in Latin are generally pronounced as they are in English, with a few exceptions. For instance, 'C' is always hard, as in 'cat,' and 'G' is always hard, as in 'go.'
