### Introduction to Latin Alphabet and Pronunciation

Latin, the language of ancient Rome, begins with its alphabet. The Latin alphabet is the foundation of many modern languages, including English. This week, students will learn the Latin alphabet, which consists of 23 letters. Unlike English, Latin does not include the letters J, U, and W.

Correct pronunciation is crucial in Latin. Each letter has a distinct sound, and vowels are pronounced clearly. For example, 'a' is always pronounced as 'ah', similar to the 'a' in 'father'.

To aid memorization, we will use the following chant:

```
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, K, L, M, N, O,
P, Q, R, S, T, U, X, Y, Z.
```

This chant helps students internalize the sequence and sounds of the Latin alphabet, setting a strong foundation for future learning.
