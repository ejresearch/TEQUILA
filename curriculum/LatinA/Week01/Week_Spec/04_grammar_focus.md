### Introduction to Latin Alphabet and Sounds

The Latin alphabet consists of 23 letters, similar to the English alphabet but without J, U, and W. Each letter has a distinct sound, which is crucial for proper pronunciation. Understanding these sounds lays the foundation for reading and speaking Latin fluently.

To begin, focus on the vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Each vowel has a long and short sound. For example, 'A' is pronounced 'ah' as in 'father'.

Consonants like 'C' and 'G' are always hard, as in 'cat' and 'go'. Practice these sounds with the chant:

```
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P,
Q, R, S, T, U, X, Y, Z.
```

This chant will help you remember the order and sounds of the Latin letters, building a strong foundation for future lessons.
