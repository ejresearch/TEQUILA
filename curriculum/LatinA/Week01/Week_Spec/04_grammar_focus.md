### Grammar Focus: Introduction to the Latin Alphabet

Latin uses the same alphabet as English, with a few differences in pronunciation. This week, we will learn to recognize and pronounce each letter correctly. The Latin alphabet consists of 23 letters, excluding 'J', 'U', and 'W'.

To help memorize the alphabet, we will use the following chant:

```
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
H, I, K, L, M, N, O,
P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Y, Z.
```

Understanding the alphabet is the first step in reading and writing Latin. It lays the foundation for all future learning in this language.
