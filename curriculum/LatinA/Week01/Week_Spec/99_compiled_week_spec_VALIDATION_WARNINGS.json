  "grammar_focus": "### Introduction to the Latin Alphabet and Sounds\n\nThe Latin alphabet is the foundation of our study. It consists of 23 letters, each with its unique sound. Unlike English, Latin pronunciation is consistent, making it easier to learn once the basic sounds are mastered.\n\nTo begin, we focus on the vowels: A, E, I, O, U. Each vowel has a long and short sound. For example, 'A' is pronounced as /aː/ in 'aqua' (water).\n\nConsonants in Latin are generally pronounced as they are in English, with a few exceptions. For instance, 'C' is always hard, as in 'cat,' and 'G' is always hard, as in 'go.'\n\n```latin\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z\n```\n\nThis chant helps students remember the order and sound of each letter, setting the stage for reading and writing in Latin.",

Next week, we'll build on this by introducing simple words.\n- **Encouragement**: Remind students that discipline in practice leads to mastery.",
