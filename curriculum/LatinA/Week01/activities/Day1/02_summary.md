# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to the concept of ecosystems, learning key vocabulary and understanding the basic interactions within these natural communities.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about different types of living organisms and their basic needs.
- Familiarity with the concept of habitats and how animals and plants adapt to their environments.

## Focus for Today
- **Grammar:** Introduction to simple present tense to describe habitual actions in ecosystems.
- **Chant:** "Ecosystems, big and small, nature's balance, hear the call."
- **Vocabulary:**
  - Ecosystem
  - Habitat
  - Organism
  - Interaction
  - Community
  - Environment
  - Adaptation

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's virtue is "Harmony," reflecting how ecosystems thrive when all parts work together. The faith phrase "All creation sings in harmony" reminds us of the interconnectedness of life.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pronounce "ecosystem" slowly, emphasizing each syllable: e-co-sys-tem. Allow time for students to practice the chant, focusing on rhythm and clarity. This will help reinforce the vocabulary and the concept of balance within ecosystems.
