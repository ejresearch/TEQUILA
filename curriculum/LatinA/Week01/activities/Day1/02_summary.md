# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will begin their journey into Latin by learning about the basic structure of Latin nouns, focusing on their forms and functions in sentences.

## Prior Knowledge
- Understanding of basic English grammar, such as nouns and their role in sentences.
- Familiarity with the concept of gender in language, as seen in languages like Spanish or French.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to the concept of declensions and the nominative case.
- Chant: A simple chant to help memorize the first declension endings.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella (girl)
  - agricola (farmer)
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - nauta (sailor)
  - poeta (poet)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
As we explore the structure of Latin nouns, we reflect on the virtue of diligence, recognizing the importance of careful study and practice. Our faith phrase reminds us that "Veritas vos liberabit"â€”"The truth will set you free," encouraging us to seek truth in our learning.

## Teacher Notes
Begin with a brief review of what nouns are in English to set the stage. Emphasize the pronunciation of Latin vowels, which are consistent and clear, unlike in English. Encourage students to practice the chant regularly to internalize the noun endings.
