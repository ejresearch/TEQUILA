# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Fractions

## Objective
Today, students will learn the basic concept of fractions, understanding how they represent parts of a whole. They will also be introduced to simple fraction vocabulary and symbols.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about whole numbers and their place value.
- They understand basic addition and subtraction, which will help in grasping the concept of combining and separating parts.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to mathematical symbols and their meanings.
- Chant: {}
- Vocabulary: Fraction, numerator, denominator, whole, part, equal, divide, share

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Todayâ€™s lesson emphasizes the virtue of patience, as understanding fractions requires careful thought and practice. The faith phrase "Every part has its place" reminds us that each fraction, like each person, is important in the grand design.

## Teacher Notes
Begin with a simple explanation of what a fraction is, using visual aids like pie charts or fraction bars. Encourage students to use their hands or objects to physically divide items into parts. Remind them that the numerator is the top number, indicating how many parts we have, while the denominator is the bottom number, showing how many equal parts the whole is divided into. Keep the pace steady, allowing time for questions and practice.
