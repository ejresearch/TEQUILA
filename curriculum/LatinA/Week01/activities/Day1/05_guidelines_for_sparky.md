# Week 1 Day 1: Latin Foundations: Alphabet and Pronunciation

## Objectives & Success Criteria
### Objectives
- Recognize and pronounce Latin alphabet letters.
- Understand basic Latin vowel and consonant sounds.
- Memorize and translate 'In principio'.
- Demonstrate discipline in pronunciation practice.

### Success Criteria
- Students pronounce Latin letters correctly.
- Students recite the alphabet chant confidently.
- Students explain the meaning of 'In principio'.
- Students show discipline in practice.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (Amicus, Bonus, Civis, Dominus, Equus)
- Parsing worksheet (cases, numbers)
- Visual aids for vowel and consonant sounds

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we explore the Latin alphabet. Let's start with some familiar words!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral.
- Ask: "What does 'Amicus' mean?" (Hint: It's someone who helps you and is kind.)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "What sound does 'C' make in Latin?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce the letter 'C'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job with that sound! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to letters as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the alphabet chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet pronunciation, vowel and consonant sounds

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is always hard like 'cat'. Let's explore more sounds!"

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: Latin alphabet sounds.
- Show example: "A is 'ah' like in 'Amicus'."
- Parse together: "What sound does 'G' make?"
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' pronunciation
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'G' make?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Keep practicing, you're getting better! Let's try some letters together."

**Activity:**
- Present practice letters: A, E, I, O, U.
- Students pronounce with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds.
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to create a new chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'In principio'?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's practice our pronunciation with discipline, just like a musician practices daily to improve."

**Faith Integration:**
"Remember, 'In principio' means 'In the beginning'. Let's use it as we close."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success_criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio."

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' pronunciation
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds, practice in pairs for peer support.
- **Extension:** Challenge students to create a new chant, explore additional Latin words starting with each letter.

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth between activities.
- Use a timer for focused practice sessions.
