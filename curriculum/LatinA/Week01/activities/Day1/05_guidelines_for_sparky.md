# Week 1 Day 1: Latin Foundations: Alphabet and Pronunciation

## Objectives & Success Criteria
### Objectives
- Recognize and pronounce Latin alphabet letters.
- Understand basic Latin vowel and consonant sounds.
- Connect discipline with pronunciation practice.

### Success Criteria
- Students pronounce each letter clearly.
- Students recite the alphabet chant accurately.
- Students explain the sound of 'C' and 'G'.
- Students connect discipline with practice.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (Aqua, Bellum, Civitas, Dominus, Equus)
- Parsing worksheet (basic vowel and consonant sounds)
- Visual aids for letter sounds

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, amici! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we learn the Latin alphabet. Let's start with some words we might know!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral.
- Ask: "What does 'Aqua' mean?" (Hint: It's something we drink!)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "Remember, 'C' is like 'cat'!"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce the letter 'A'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job with that sound! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to letters as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the first part of the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet recognition, pronunciation of vowels and consonants

**Sparky says:**
"Let's explore how each letter sounds. Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Activity:**
- Introduce the Latin alphabet and its sounds.
- Show example words (Aqua, Bellum).
- Practice pronunciation together.
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'C' make in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Keep practicing, you're getting better! Let's try some more letters."

**Activity:**
- Present practice letters (A, E, I, O, U).
- Students pronounce with guidance.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds.
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to find Latin words starting with each letter.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do we say 'G' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Practice makes perfect! Let's be disciplined like Latin learners."

**Faith Integration:**
"Remember, 'In principio' means 'In the beginning'. Let's use it to start our learning journey!"

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio."

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."
- **Pattern:** Soft 'G' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "'G' is always hard, like 'goat'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds, provide extra practice with vowel sounds.
- **Extension:** Challenge students to find Latin words starting with each letter, explore the history of the Latin alphabet.

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth with clear signals.
- Use a timer for chant practice.
- Encourage quiet listening during pronunciation.
