# Week 1 Day 2: Introduction to Fractions

## Objective
Today, students will learn the basics of fractions, understanding how they represent parts of a whole and how to identify numerators and denominators.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about whole numbers and their properties.
- Familiarity with basic addition and subtraction will aid in understanding how fractions can be combined or separated.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Understanding mathematical language and symbols related to fractions.
- Chant: {}
- Vocabulary: Fraction, Numerator, Denominator, Whole, Part, Equal, Divide, Share

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Understanding fractions teaches us about balance and fairness, reflecting the virtue of justice. Just as fractions divide a whole into equal parts, we learn to share and distribute resources fairly.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to visualize fractions using everyday objects like pizza slices or pie pieces. Remind them that the numerator is the number of parts we have, and the denominator is the total number of equal parts. Use clear, slow pronunciation when introducing new vocabulary, and allow time for students to practice saying the words aloud.
