## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we learn the Latin alphabet. Let's start with some words we know!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral.
- Ask: "What does 'Amicus' mean?" (Hint: It's someone who is friendly to you.)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "What sound does 'C' make?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'C' make?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's say the alphabet together! We'll chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to letters as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What comes after 'G' in the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet pronunciation, vowel and consonant sounds

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is like 'cat'. Let's try saying 'In principio' together."

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: Latin alphabet sounds.
- Show example sentence: "In principio erat Verbum."
- Parse together: Identify 'In principio' and its meaning.
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you say 'In principio'?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Keep practicing, you're doing great! Let's try some more letters."

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences with letters.
- Students pronounce with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds.
  - **Extension:** Challenge with additional Latin words.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do we pronounce 'A'?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Practice the chant daily to build discipline, just like learning a new skill."

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'In principio' during transitions to reinforce its meaning and pronunciation."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success_criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio - In the beginning."

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."
- **Pattern:** Silent 'H'
  **Correction Cue:** "In Latin, 'H' is pronounced, like 'hah'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds, practice in pairs for peer support.
- **Extension:** Challenge with additional Latin words, create a short chant using new words.

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth with the chant.
- Use hand signals for quieting down.
