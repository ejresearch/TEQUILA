## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, discipulī! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we learn Latin. Let's start with some vocabulary!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: "What does 'aqua' mean?" (Hint: It's something we drink!)
- Recycle grammar: "What sound does 'a' make in Latin?" (Remember, it's 'ah' like in 'father'.)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the alphabet without help?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's chant the alphabet together! First slowly, then with rhythm. Remember, 'a' is 'ah'!"

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant: "A, B, C, D, E, F, G..."
- Students echo, pointing to letters
- Repeat with rhythm

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'a' make in Latin?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet recitation, vowel pronunciation

**Sparky says:**
"Let's look at how each letter sounds. Which letter is like 'ah' in 'father'?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce Latin alphabet (23 letters)
- Show example: "Aqua est necessaria."
- Parse together: "What is 'aqua'? It's a noun meaning 'water'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'water' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Try saying 'amicus'. Remember, it's 'ah-MEE-koos'."

**Activity:**
- Practice sentences: "Amicus bonus est."
- Students parse: "What does 'amicus' mean?"
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for pronunciation
  - **Extension:** Challenge to write the alphabet from memory

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce 'amicus' correctly?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Discipline helps us learn better! Let's say 'In principio' together."

**Faith Integration:**
"Remember, 'In principio' means 'In the beginning'. It's a great way to start our learning!"

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess: "Did you chant with enthusiasm?"
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio!"

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Mispronouncing 'a' as 'ay'
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'a' is 'ah' like in 'father'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for the alphabet, pair with a buddy for practice
- **Extension:** Challenge to write the alphabet from memory, introduce a new vocabulary word

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth with clear signals
- Use a timer for chant practice
- Encourage participation with positive feedback
