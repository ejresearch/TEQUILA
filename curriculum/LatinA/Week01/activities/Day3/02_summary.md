Today, students will review and reinforce their understanding of Latin nouns, focusing on their forms and functions within sentences.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the basic structure of Latin sentences, which includes subjects and predicates.
- Familiarity with the Latin alphabet and pronunciation has been established.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Review of Latin noun cases and their uses.
- Chant: Reinforce noun declension endings through rhythmic repetition.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella
  - servus
  - bellum
  - aqua
  - terra

  - nauta

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's virtue focuses on perseverance, encouraging students to persist in mastering noun declensions. The faith phrase "Fides et Veritas" (Faith and Truth) reminds us of the importance of truth in language learning.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the noun endings aloud to aid memorization. Remind them to pay attention to vowel lengths for accurate pronunciation. Allow time for questions and ensure students can identify noun cases in simple sentences.
