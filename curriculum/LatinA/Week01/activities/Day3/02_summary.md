# Week 1 Day 3: Introduction to Fractions

## Objective
Today, students will review the basic concepts of fractions, ensuring they can identify and represent fractions using visual aids and simple equations.

## Prior Knowledge
- Understanding of whole numbers and their place on a number line.
- Basic addition and subtraction skills.
- Familiarity with shapes and partitioning them into equal parts.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: N/A
- Chant: N/A
- Vocabulary: Fraction, numerator, denominator, equal parts, whole, half, quarter, third

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of patience, as students learn to carefully divide and understand parts of a whole. The faith phrase "Unity in diversity" reflects how different parts come together to form a complete whole, much like fractions.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to use visual aids like fraction circles or bars to better understand the concept of fractions. Remind them to pronounce "numerator" and "denominator" clearly, as these terms will be frequently used. Allow time for questions and ensure students can relate fractions to real-world examples, such as slicing a pizza or sharing a chocolate bar.
