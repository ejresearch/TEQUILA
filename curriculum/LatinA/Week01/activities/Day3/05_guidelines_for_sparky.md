## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, amici! Today we'll practice **Discipline** by focusing on clear pronunciation. Let's start with some words we know!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: "What does 'aqua' mean?" (Hint: It's something we drink!)
- Recycle grammar: "Let's say the alphabet together. Remember, no skipping!"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the alphabet without looking?"

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job on those vowels! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant slowly, then at tempo
- Students echo
- Point to letters as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'a' make in Latin?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet recitation, correct pronunciation of vowels

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'a' is always 'ah'. Let's see how it sounds in some words."

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: Latin alphabet and vowel sounds
- Show example sentence: "Aqua est necessaria."
- Parse together: Identify vowels and their sounds
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Mispronouncing 'a' as in 'cat'
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'a' is like 'ah' in 'father'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'water' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Who can say 'amicus' like a pro? Let's try it together!"

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences: "Amicus bonus est."
- Students pronounce with guidance
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for pronunciation
  - **Extension:** Challenge with new vocabulary words

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce 'amicus' correctly?"

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Discipline helps us learn better! Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin."

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's remember 'In principio' means 'In the beginning'. Use 'Gloria Deo' as a cheerful closure after correct parsing."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio"
