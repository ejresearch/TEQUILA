## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, amici! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we learn our Latin letters. Let's start with some words we know!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: Aqua, Bellum, Civitas
- Ask: "What does 'Aqua' mean?" (Hint: Think of water!)
- Recycle grammar: "How does 'C' sound in 'Civitas'?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce 'C' correctly?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's say the alphabet together! We'll do it slowly first, then with some rhythm. Ready?"

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant: slowly, then at tempo
- Students echo
- Point to letters as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Who can recite the alphabet chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Pronunciation of Latin letters A-H, Hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is like 'cat'! Let's try some words together."

**Activity:**
- Introduce pronunciation of A-H
- Show example words: Aqua, Bellum, Civitas
- Parse together: focus on hard 'C' and 'G'
- Highlight misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'G' make?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's try some sentences together. Remember, practice makes perfect!"

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences
- Students pronounce with scaffolding
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to spell simple Latin words

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How does discipline help us learn?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Practice the alphabet chant daily to build discipline. Notice each letter carefully!"

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's begin with 'In principio' to set our tone for learning."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio"

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."
- **Pattern:** Soft 'G' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "'G' is always hard, like 'go'."
