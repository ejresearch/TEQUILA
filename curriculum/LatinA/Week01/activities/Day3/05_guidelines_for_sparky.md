## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we master the Latin alphabet. Let's start by reviewing some words!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral.
- Ask: "What does 'Amicus' mean?" (Hint: It's someone who helps you when you're in need.)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "What sound does 'C' make in 'Civis'?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce the letter 'C'?"

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job on that letter! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to letters as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the alphabet chant?"

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet pronunciation, hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is like 'cat'! Let's practice together."

**Activity:**
- Introduce the hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'.
- Show example words: "Civis" and "Gloria".
- Parse together, focusing on pronunciation.
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'G' make?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Keep practicing, you're getting better! Let's try some sentences."

**Activity:**
- Present 3–5 practice sentences.
- Students pronounce with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds.
  - **Extension:** Challenge with additional Latin words.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How does discipline help us learn?"

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's practice our letters every day to become masters of Latin!"

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'In principio' as we begin our journey into Latin."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio."
