They should also be familiar with the concept of nouns in English, including their role as subjects and objects in sentences. Prior exposure to the idea of grammatical gender and number in languages like Spanish or French will be beneficial, as Latin also uses these concepts. Students should recall the vocabulary introduced in the first two days, such as 'amicus' (friend) and 'familia' (family).",
