# Week 1 Day 4: Introduction to Fractions

## Objective
Today, students will explore the concept of fractions, understanding how they represent parts of a whole and how to identify and create simple fractions.

## Prior Knowledge
- **Counting and Number Recognition:** Students have practiced counting numbers up to 100, which helps in understanding parts of a whole.
- **Basic Addition and Subtraction:** Familiarity with these operations aids in grasping how fractions can be combined or separated.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: 
- Chant: {}
- Vocabulary: Fraction, Whole, Half, Quarter, Numerator, Denominator, Equal Parts, Divide

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Understanding fractions teaches us about sharing and fairness, reflecting the virtue of justice. Just as we learn to divide things equally, we are reminded of the faith phrase "Love your neighbor as yourself," promoting equality and kindness.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to visualize fractions using everyday objects like fruits or paper shapes. Remind them to pronounce "numerator" and "denominator" clearly, emphasizing the syllables to aid memory. Allow time for hands-on activities to solidify their understanding of fractions as parts of a whole.
