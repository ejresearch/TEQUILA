- Chant: Practice chanting noun endings to reinforce memory.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella
  - servus

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin nouns encourages precision and clarity, virtues that reflect the faith phrase "Veritas vos liberabit" (The truth will set you free), reminding us that understanding language brings clarity and truth.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pronounce each noun clearly, emphasizing the endings. Spend time on the chant to help students internalize the noun endings, which are crucial for recognizing and using nouns correctly in Latin sentences. Consider using visual aids to show how nouns change form based on their role in a sentence.
