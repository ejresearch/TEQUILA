## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson connects to the virtue of patience, as understanding fractions requires careful thought and practice. The faith phrase "Every part has its purpose" reminds us that each fraction, like each person, is important in its own way.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to use manipulatives, such as fraction circles or bars, to visualize fractions. Remind them to pronounce "numerator" and "denominator" clearly, emphasizing the syllables to aid retention. Allow time for students to explore fractions with hands-on activities to solidify their understanding.
