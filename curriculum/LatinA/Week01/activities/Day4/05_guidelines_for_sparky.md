## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we master our Latin sounds. Let's start with some words we know!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: Aqua, Bellum, Civitas
- Ask: "What does 'Aqua' mean?" (Hint: It's something we drink!)
- Recycle grammar: "How do we say 'C' in Latin?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you pronounce the letter 'C'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's say the letters together! We'll chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo)
- Students echo
- Point to each letter as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Who can recite the first part of the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Pronunciation of Latin letters A-H, Understanding hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is always hard, like in 'cat'. Let's practice together!"

**Activity:**
- Introduce pronunciation rules for 'C' and 'G'
- Show example words: Civitas, Gloria
- Practice pronunciation as a group
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard in Latin."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'G' make in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job! Keep practicing! Let's try some words together."

**Activity:**
- Present practice words: Aqua, Bellum, Civitas
- Students pronounce with guidance
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to spell simple words

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Why is 'In principio' important?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Practice makes perfect! Let's use discipline to master our Latin sounds."

**Faith Integration:**
"Remember, 'In principio' connects us to the beginning of our learning journey."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio"

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard in Latin."
- **Pattern:** Soft 'G' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "In Latin, 'G' is always hard, like 'go'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds, Pair students for chant practice
- **Extension:** Challenge students to spell simple words, Introduce additional Latin vocabulary

### Classroom Management
