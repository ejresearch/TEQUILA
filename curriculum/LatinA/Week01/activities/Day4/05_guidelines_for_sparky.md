## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, discipulī! Today we'll practice **Discipline** as we learn our Latin letters. Just like a musician practices every day, we'll get better with each try!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral: Amicus, Bonus, Civis, Dominus, Equus.
- Ask: "What does 'Amicus' mean?" (Hint: It's someone who is friendly to you.)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "Let's remember our vowel sounds!"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do we pronounce 'C'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm. Remember, discipline helps us get better every day!"

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the alphabet chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Latin alphabet pronunciation, hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, 'C' is always hard, like in 'cat'. Can you say 'G' like in 'go'?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: Hard sounds of 'C' and 'G'.
- Show example sentence: "Civis" and "Gloria".
- Parse together: "Civis" (citizen), "Gloria" (glory).
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Soft 'C' sound
  - Correction cue: "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like in 'cat'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What sound does 'G' make?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Try the sentence pattern A before B. Let's see how well you can pronounce these letters!"

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences with vocabulary words.
- Students pronounce and parse with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds.
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to spell simple Latin words.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'In principio' mean?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin. Discipline helps us learn!"

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's start with 'In principio' to set a positive tone for our learning."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success_criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "In principio."

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Soft 'C' sound
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, 'C' is always hard, like in 'cat'."

  **Correction Cue:** "'G' is hard, like in 'go'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for letter sounds, pair students for chant practice.
- **Extension:** Challenge students to spell simple Latin words, introduce additional Latin letters for advanced practice.
