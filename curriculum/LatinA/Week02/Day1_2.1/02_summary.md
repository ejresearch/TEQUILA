# Latin A – Week 00 Day 1 : Discovering the World of Nouns – Discovery

## Objective
Today, students will begin their journey into the world of Latin nouns, focusing on understanding noun declensions and expanding their vocabulary with key Latin words.

## Prior Knowledge
Students have previously been introduced to basic Latin greetings such as "salve" and "vale," and have learned simple vocabulary like "puella" (girl) and "puer" (boy), which will aid in understanding noun forms.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to noun declensions, focusing on the first declension.
- Chant: A rhythmic chant to help memorize the endings of the first declension.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella (girl)
  - terra (earth)
  - aqua (water)
  - nauta (sailor)
  - agricola (farmer)
  - femina (woman)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of nouns reflects the virtue of clarity, as understanding the structure of language brings clarity to communication. The faith phrase "Deus est lux" (God is light) reminds us that learning illuminates our path.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the declension endings aloud to reinforce memory. Remind them to pronounce each vowel clearly, as Latin pronunciation relies on distinct vowel sounds. Pacing should allow time for repetition and practice of both vocabulary and declension forms.
