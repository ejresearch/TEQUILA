# Week 0 Day 1: Introduction to Latin Nouns and Declensions

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to the concept of Latin nouns and their declensions, focusing on understanding how nouns change form to express different grammatical cases.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned basic Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water).
- Familiarity with simple Latin greetings like "salve" (hello) will aid in pronunciation practice.

## Focus for Today
- **Grammar:** Introduction to the first declension of Latin nouns.
- **Chant:** A rhythmic chant to help memorize the first declension endings.
- **Vocabulary:**
  - puella (girl)
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - via (road)
  - agricola (farmer)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin declensions highlights the virtue of diligence, as students learn to carefully observe the changes in noun endings. The faith phrase "Deus est bonus" (God is good) reminds us of the constancy and goodness in our studies.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice the pronunciation of each noun carefully, emphasizing the vowel sounds. Use the chant to reinforce the pattern of endings in the first declension, and remind students that repetition will aid in memorization.
