## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)

"Great job with 'puella'! Let's chant the endings together: 'a, ae, ae, am, ā'. We'll do it slowly first."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant slowly, then at tempo
- Students echo
- Point to endings as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**

**Activity:**
- Introduce first declension grammar concept
- Show example sentence: "Puella in horto est."
- Parse together: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative

"Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin. Patience helps us learn better!"

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's use 'Gloria Patri' as a cheerful closure after our practice."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri"
