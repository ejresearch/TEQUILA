# Week 1 Day 1: First Declension Nouns (Singular)

## Objectives & Success Criteria
### Objectives
- Identify first declension nouns in singular form.
- Pronounce new vocabulary accurately.
- Recite the nominative singular chant.

### Success Criteria
- Students can identify first declension nouns.
- Students pronounce vocabulary correctly.
- Students recite the chant accurately.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (salve, puella, rosa)
- Parsing worksheet (cases, numbers)
- Visual aids for vocabulary

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Patience** as we learn new Latin words."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: "salve," "puella," "rosa."
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: It's someone you might see in a garden.)
- Review: "How do we say 'hello' in Latin?" (Hint: It's a friendly greeting.)

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the ending for 'puella'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm. Remember, patience helps us learn better!"

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart: "a, ae, ae, am, ā"
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo)
- Students echo
- Point to endings as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** First declension noun endings

**Sparky says:**
"Which case tells who/what does the action? Let's find out!"

**Activity:**
- Introduce first declension nouns ending in '-a'
- Example sentence: "Puella in horto est."
- Parse together: "Puella" is nominative singular.
- Highlight common misconception: Mispronouncing "via" as "v-eye-a." Correction: "Say 'vee-a' like 'see-a'."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'hello' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Try the sentence pattern A before B. Let's practice together!"

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences: "Rosa pulchra est," "Aqua clara est."
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for vocabulary.
  - **Extension:** Create sentences using new words.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'Gloria Patri' mean?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin."

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'Gloria Deo' as a cheerful closure after correct parsing."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri"

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Mispronouncing "via" as "v-eye-a"
  **Correction Cue:** "Say 'vee-a' like 'see-a'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for vocabulary, pair students for chant practice.
- **Extension:** Create sentences using new words, explore additional first declension nouns.

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth with clear signals.
