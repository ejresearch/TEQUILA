1. Vocabulary: Review the word 'salve' (hello) which students have encountered in greetings.
2. Grammar: Revisit the first declension noun endings: a/ae/ae/am/ā for singular and ae/ārum/īs/ās/īs for plural.
3. Verb Forms: Recall the present tense conjugation of 'sum' (to be): sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt.
