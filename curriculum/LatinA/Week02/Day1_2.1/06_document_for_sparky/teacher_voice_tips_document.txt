When teaching today's lesson, emphasize the importance of understanding the function of each case in Latin. Use visual aids, such as charts or flashcards, to reinforce the declension endings. Encourage students to chant along with you, using the rhythm and motions to aid memorization.

Be patient and provide plenty of examples to illustrate how each case is used in sentences. Encourage students to ask questions and explore the connections between Latin and English grammar. Reinforce the virtue of patience by reminding students that mastery takes time and practice.
