When introducing the first declension, emphasize the importance of endings in determining the role of a noun in a sentence. Use clear examples and visual aids to show how changing an ending changes the meaning. Encourage students to chant along with you to internalize the patterns. Use positive reinforcement to build confidence as students practice declensions. Highlight connections between Latin and English to enhance understanding and retention.
