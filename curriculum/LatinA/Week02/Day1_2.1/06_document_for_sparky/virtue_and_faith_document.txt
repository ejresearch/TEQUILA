The virtue of 'fortitudo' (courage) connects to our lessons as students are encouraged to bravely tackle new challenges in learning Latin. The faith phrase for the week is 'Deus est fortis' (God is strong), reminding us of the strength we can draw from faith. This phrase is inspired by Psalm 46:1, "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble."
