Virtue of the Week: Patience

In our Latin studies, patience is essential as we learn to carefully analyze and translate sentences. Just as the Romans valued patience in their pursuits, we too can cultivate this virtue in our studies.

Faith Phrase: "Deus est amor" (God is love)

This phrase reminds us of the central Christian teaching that God's nature is love. It encourages us to reflect on how we can embody love in our actions. Scripture Reference: 1 John 4:8, which speaks to the nature of God as love.
