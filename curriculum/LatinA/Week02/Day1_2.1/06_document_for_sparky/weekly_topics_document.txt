This week, we focus on the first declension of Latin nouns. Students will learn to identify and use the nominative and accusative cases in simple sentences. Our skill goals include recognizing first declension endings and applying them in context. The virtue of the week is 'fortitudo' (courage), and our mastery indicator will be students' ability to correctly decline first declension nouns in both singular and plural forms.
