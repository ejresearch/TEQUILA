# Week 0 Day 2: Introduction to Latin Noun Declensions

## Objective
Today, students will learn to identify and practice the first declension of Latin nouns, focusing on their endings and meanings.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned basic Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water).
- Familiarity with the concept of noun endings and their importance in Latin.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: First declension noun endings
- Chant: Recitation of first declension endings
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, via, femina, agricola, poeta, nauta

## Virtue & Faith Connection
As students explore the structure of Latin, they are encouraged to reflect on the virtue of diligence, applying careful attention to detail in their studies. The faith phrase "Deus est bonus" (God is good) reminds them of the goodness in learning and understanding.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the declension endings aloud, focusing on clear pronunciation. Remind them that Latin nouns change form based on their role in a sentence, and practice with examples will build confidence. Allow time for repetition and correction to ensure mastery of the first declension forms.
