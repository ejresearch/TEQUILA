# Latin A – Week 00 Day 2 : Exploring the World of –a Nouns – Practice

## Objective
Today, students will practice translating and reciting Latin nouns ending in "-a," focusing on their declensions and proper pronunciation.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have been introduced to the concept of Latin declensions, particularly the first declension.
- Familiarity with basic Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water) has been established.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: First declension nouns, emphasizing nominative and accusative cases.
- Chant: Recitation of first declension noun endings.
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, via, silva, mensa, stella, luna

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin nouns reflects the virtue of diligence, as students carefully learn and recite each form. The faith phrase "Deus est lux" (God is light) reminds us of the clarity and understanding that comes from dedicated study.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the noun endings aloud to reinforce memory. Remind them to pay attention to vowel lengths and pronunciation, particularly in words like "aqua" and "terra." Allow time for individual practice and group recitation to build confidence.
