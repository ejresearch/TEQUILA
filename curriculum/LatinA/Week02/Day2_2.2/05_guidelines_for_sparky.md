## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Patience** as we learn Latin. Let's start with some vocabulary!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral: "salve", "puella", "rosa".
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: Think of a young person in a garden.)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: Practice saying "Salve" in different tones.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the nominative singular ending?"

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job! Let's try that again. Remember, patience is key! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant: "a, ae, ae, am, ā" (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** First declension noun endings, correct pronunciation

**Sparky says:**
"Listen carefully to the pronunciation. Which case tells who/what does the action?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: First declension nouns.
- Show example sentence: "Puella in horto est."
- Parse together: Identify case, number.
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Mispronouncing 'puella' as 'pwe-la'.
  - Correction cue: "Remember, it's 'pwel-la' with a clear 'w' sound."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you say 'puella' correctly?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"You're doing amazing! Keep it up! Try the sentence pattern A before B."

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences: "Rosa pulchra est.", "Via longa est."
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for vocabulary.
  - **Extension:** Create simple sentences using new vocabulary.

**Check for Understanding:**

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Learning Latin takes time. Let's practice patience together! Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin."

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'Gloria Deo' as a cheerful closure after correct parsing."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success_criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri."
