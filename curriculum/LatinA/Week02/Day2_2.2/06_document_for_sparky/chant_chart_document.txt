Today's chant focuses on the first declension noun endings:

Singular: a/ae/ae/am/ā
Plural: ae/ārum/īs/ās/īs

Use hand motions to indicate singular (one hand) and plural (both hands). As you chant, point to different parts of the room to represent the different cases: nominative (straight ahead), genitive (above head), dative (to the side), accusative (forward), and ablative (downward).
