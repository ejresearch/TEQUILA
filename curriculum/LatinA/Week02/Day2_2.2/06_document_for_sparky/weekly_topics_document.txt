This week, we focus on the first declension of Latin nouns, aiming to familiarize students with the endings and their uses in sentences. The skill goal is to correctly identify and use the nominative and accusative cases. The virtue of the week is 'perseverance', encouraging students to persist in their studies. Mastery will be indicated by students' ability to translate simple Latin sentences using first declension nouns.
