This week, we are focusing on the first declension of Latin nouns. Students will learn to identify and use the nominative and accusative cases in simple sentences. Our skill goals include recognizing the endings of first declension nouns and using them correctly in context. The virtue of the week is "fortitudo" (courage), and our mastery indicator will be the ability to translate simple Latin sentences using first declension nouns.
