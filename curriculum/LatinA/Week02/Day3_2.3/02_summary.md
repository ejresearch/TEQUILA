# Week 0 Day 3: Introduction to Latin Noun Declensions

## Objective
Today, students will review and reinforce their understanding of Latin noun declensions, focusing on the forms and functions of nouns in different cases.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about the basic structure of Latin nouns and their importance in sentence construction.
- Familiarity with the first declension endings, particularly in the nominative and accusative cases.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Review of Latin noun declensions, emphasizing the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases.
- Chant: Practice chanting the endings of the first declension.
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, amicus, servus, bellum, oppidum, via

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of declensions highlights the virtue of perseverance, as students diligently practice and master the forms. The faith phrase "Deus est pax" reminds us that peace comes through understanding and order, much like the structure provided by Latin grammar.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the declension endings aloud to reinforce memorization. Remind them of the importance of pronunciation, particularly with vowel lengths, to ensure clarity and accuracy in their Latin studies.
