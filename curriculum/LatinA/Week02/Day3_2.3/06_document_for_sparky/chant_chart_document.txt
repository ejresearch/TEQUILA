Today's chant will focus on the first declension noun endings. Use the following chant with clapping rhythm:

"a, ae, ae, am, ƒÅ,
First declension leads the way!
Nominative, Genitive, Dative too,
Accusative, Ablative, now you know what to do!"

Encourage students to clap along to the rhythm as they chant each ending.
