Today's spiral review will focus on reinforcing the vocabulary and grammar concepts from previous weeks. We will revisit the greeting 'salve' and its usage in conversation. Additionally, we will review the first declension noun endings: 'a/ae/ae/am/ƒÅ' and practice using these endings with previously learned nouns such as 'puella' and 'aqua'.
