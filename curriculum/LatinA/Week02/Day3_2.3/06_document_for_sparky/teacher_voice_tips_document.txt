When teaching this lesson, use clear and deliberate pronunciation of Latin words to help students grasp the sounds. Encourage students to repeat after you, ensuring they articulate each syllable. Use gestures and motions to reinforce the chant, making it a kinesthetic learning experience. Be patient and provide positive reinforcement as students practice declensions, emphasizing the importance of accuracy over speed. Integrate the virtue of patience by modeling it in your teaching approach, allowing students time to process and understand the material.
