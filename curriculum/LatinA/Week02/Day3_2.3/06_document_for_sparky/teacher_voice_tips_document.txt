When teaching today's lesson, focus on clear pronunciation of Latin words. Use repetition to help students internalize the first declension endings. Encourage students to participate actively in the chant, using clapping to reinforce the rhythm and structure of the declension. Provide examples and model sentences to demonstrate the application of vocabulary in context. Engage students with questions to check for understanding and offer positive reinforcement to build their confidence in learning Latin.
