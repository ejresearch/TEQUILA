The virtue of 'fortitudo' (courage) is exemplified in our lessons as students learn to tackle new challenges in Latin grammar. The faith phrase for this week is 'Deus est fortis', meaning 'God is strong'. This phrase reminds us of the strength we can find in faith. A relevant scripture reference is Joshua 1:9, which encourages us to be strong and courageous.
