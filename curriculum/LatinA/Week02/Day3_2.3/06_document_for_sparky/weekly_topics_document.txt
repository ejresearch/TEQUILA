This week, students will focus on the first declension of Latin nouns, specifically the nominative and accusative cases. The skill goals include identifying and using these cases in simple sentences. The virtue of the week is 'patience,' which will be integrated into classroom activities. Mastery will be indicated by students correctly declining first declension nouns and using them in context.
