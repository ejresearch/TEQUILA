This week, we are focusing on the first declension in Latin. Our skill goals include mastering the first declension noun endings and understanding how to apply them in simple sentences. The virtue of the week is 'fortitudo' (courage), and our mastery indicator will be the ability to correctly decline first declension nouns and use them in context.
