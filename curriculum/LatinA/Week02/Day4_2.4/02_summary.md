# Week 0 Day 4: Introduction to First Declension Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will learn about the first declension nouns in Latin, focusing on their endings and how they change according to case and number.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned basic Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water).
- They have been introduced to the concept of Latin cases and how they affect the form of nouns.

## Focus for Today
- **Grammar:** Introduction to the first declension, including nominative and accusative cases.
- **Chant:** Practice chanting the first declension endings: -a, -ae, -am, -ƒÅ.
- **Vocabulary:**
  - puella (girl)
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - via (road)
  - silva (forest)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
In studying the first declension, students can reflect on the virtue of diligence, as mastering these foundational elements requires careful attention and practice. The faith phrase "Deus amat" (God loves) reminds us of the importance of love in all our endeavors.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the declension endings aloud to reinforce pronunciation and memory. Remind them that the nominative case is often used for the subject of a sentence, while the accusative is used for the direct object. This foundational understanding will aid in translating simple Latin sentences.
