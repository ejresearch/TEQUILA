Today's spiral review will focus on reinforcing the vocabulary and grammar concepts introduced in previous weeks. Specifically, review the following:

1. Vocabulary: Revisit the word 'salve' (hello) to ensure students are comfortable with greetings in Latin.
2. Grammar: Recall the first declension noun endings: 'a/ae/ae/am/ƒÅ' and practice their application in simple sentences.
3. Verb Forms: Review the present tense of the verb 'sum' (to be) - 'sum, es, est'.
