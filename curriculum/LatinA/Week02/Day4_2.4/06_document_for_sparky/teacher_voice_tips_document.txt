When teaching this lesson, emphasize clarity and repetition. Use a clear, steady voice to model the pronunciation of Latin words and encourage students to repeat after you. Incorporate gestures to represent each case ending during the chant to help students remember the forms. Encourage students to use the vocabulary in simple Latin sentences to build confidence. Reinforce the virtue of perseverance by acknowledging students' efforts and progress in mastering the declensions.
