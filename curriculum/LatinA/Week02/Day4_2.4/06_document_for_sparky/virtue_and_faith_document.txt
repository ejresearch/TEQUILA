The virtue of perseverance is highlighted this week, encouraging students to persist in their studies of Latin despite challenges. The faith phrase "Deus est amor" (God is love) reminds us of the enduring nature of divine love, as referenced in 1 John 4:8. This phrase can inspire students to approach their studies with love and dedication.
