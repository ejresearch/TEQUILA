This week, our focus is on understanding the first declension of Latin nouns. Students will learn to identify and use the nominative and accusative cases in simple sentences. The skill goals include recognizing noun endings and understanding their grammatical function in a sentence. The virtue of the week is "perseverance," which ties into the mastery indicator of accurately declining first declension nouns by the end of the week.
