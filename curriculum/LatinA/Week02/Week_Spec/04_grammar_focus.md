### Introduction to Basic Sentence Structure

This week, we explore the foundational elements of Latin sentences, focusing on simple greetings and phrases. Latin sentences often follow a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, though this can vary. Understanding this structure helps us form basic sentences, like 'Salve, discipule!' (Hello, student!).

Our chant for the week, 'Salve, discipuli!', introduces the plural form of 'discipulus' (student), showing how Latin words change to reflect number. 

```
Salve, discipuli!
Salve, magister!
```

Building on last week's vocabulary, we incorporate these words into simple exchanges, reinforcing both language and respectful communication.
