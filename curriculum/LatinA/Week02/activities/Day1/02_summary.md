# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to the basic structure of Latin nouns, focusing on their forms and functions in sentences. They will also learn a chant to help memorize noun endings.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about the Latin alphabet, which will aid in pronouncing new vocabulary.
- Basic Latin vocabulary such as "aqua" (water) and "terra" (earth) has been introduced, providing a foundation for understanding noun usage.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to Latin noun declensions, focusing on the first declension.
- Chant: A rhythmic chant to memorize the endings of first declension nouns.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella (girl)
  - agricola (farmer)
  - nauta (sailor)
  - poeta (poet)
  - femina (woman)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of diligence, as students diligently learn the foundational elements of Latin nouns. The faith phrase "Fides et Veritas" (Faith and Truth) reminds us of the importance of truth in language learning.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pronounce each Latin word clearly, paying attention to vowel lengths. The chant should be practiced slowly at first, then gradually increase in speed as students become more confident. Remind them that understanding noun endings is crucial for reading and translating Latin effectively.
