## Virtue & Faith Connection
In learning Latin nouns, students are encouraged to appreciate the beauty and order of language, reflecting the virtue of diligence. The faith phrase "Verbum Dei" (Word of God) reminds us of the power of words.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the declension endings rhythmically to reinforce memory. Remind them that Latin pronunciation is consistent, which aids in learning. Spend time reviewing the vocabulary aloud, ensuring correct pronunciation and understanding of each word's meaning.
