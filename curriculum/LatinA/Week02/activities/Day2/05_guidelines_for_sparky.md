## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, discipuli! Today, let's show respect by using our Latin greetings."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: "salve", "vale", "discipulus", "magister", "pax".
- Ask: "What does 'salve' mean?" (Hint: It's how we say hello!)
- Recycle grammar: "What is the order of words in a simple Latin sentence?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'salve' mean?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's say 'Salve, discipuli!' together. We'll do it slowly first, then with rhythm!"

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant: "Salve, discipuli! Salve, magister! Pax vobiscum! Et cum spiritu tuo!"
- Students echo.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you use 'Pax vobiscum' in a sentence?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Practice greeting phrases, introduce 'Pax vobiscum', review basic sentence structure.

**Sparky says:**
"Who can tell me what 'vale' means? Remember, it's for saying goodbye!"

**Activity:**
- Introduce Subject-Object-Verb order using example: "Salve, discipule!"
- Parse together: Identify subject and verb.
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Mispronouncing 'salve' as 'sal-vay': "Remember, it's 'SAL-veh'."
  - Using 'vale' incorrectly: "Use 'vale' when saying goodbye."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'goodbye' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's try using these words in sentences. Who can say 'Hello, teacher' in Latin?"

**Activity:**
- Present practice sentences: "Salve, magister!", "Vale, discipule!"
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for vocabulary.
  - **Extension:** Create a short dialogue using new words.

**Check for Understanding:**

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)

"Great job today! Remember, showing respect with our words is important."

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'Pax vobiscum' to promote peace in our greetings."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "Pax vobiscum."
