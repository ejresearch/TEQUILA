Students will review and assess their understanding of Latin nouns, focusing on recognizing and using the nominative and accusative cases in simple sentences.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about the Latin alphabet and basic pronunciation rules.
- Introduction to simple Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water).
- Understanding of singular and plural forms in Latin nouns.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Review of nominative and accusative cases, singular and plural forms.
- Chant: Practice chants to reinforce noun endings.
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, agricola, nauta, poeta, via, villa

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study encourages the virtue of diligence as students reflect on their progress and understanding of Latin nouns. The faith phrase "Fides et Veritas" (Faith and Truth) reminds us to seek truth in our learning journey.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant noun endings aloud to reinforce memory. Allow time for reflection on quiz results, and provide feedback to guide further learning. Remind students to pay attention to vowel lengths and pronunciation nuances, especially in the vocabulary words listed.
