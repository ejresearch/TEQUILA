## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, discipuli! Today we'll practice **Respect** as we greet each other in Latin."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: salve, vale, discipulus
- Ask: "What does 'salve' mean?" (Hint: It's how we say hello!)
- Recycle grammar: "Who remembers the plural of 'discipulus'?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'salve' mean?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job with 'salve'! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant: "Salve, discipuli! Salve, magister! Pax vobiscum! Et cum spiritu tuo!"
- Students echo
- Point to endings as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you greet a friend in Latin?"

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Practice greetings and farewells, introduce 'Pax vobiscum'.

**Sparky says:**
"Let's try 'Pax vobiscum' together. Which case tells who/what does the action?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce 'Pax vobiscum' as a greeting
- Show example sentence: "Salve, discipule!"
- Parse together: subject, object, verb
- Highlight common misconceptions:

**Check for Understanding:**

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Respect is shown in our words. Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin."

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'Pax vobiscum' as a cheerful closure after correct parsing."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "Pax vobiscum."
