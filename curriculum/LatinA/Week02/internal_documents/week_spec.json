These nouns typically end in '-a' in the nominative singular case. Understanding the endings is crucial for identifying the role of the noun in a sentence.\n\nThe chant for the first declension nominative singular is:\n\n```\na, ae, ae, am, ā\n```\n\nThis chant helps students remember the endings for the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases. Building on last week's introduction to Latin pronunciation, students will now apply these endings to new vocabulary words."
