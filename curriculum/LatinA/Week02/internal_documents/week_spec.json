The first declension is primarily feminine, though there are exceptions. We will use the chant 'a, ae, ae, am, ā' to memorize the endings for nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases.\n\n```latin\nNominative: puella\nGenitive: puellae\nDative: puellae\nAccusative: puellam\nAblative: puellā\n```\n\nUnderstanding these endings helps students identify the role of the noun in a sentence. We will build on the pronunciation skills from Week 1, ensuring students can confidently chant and recognize these forms."

As students encounter new vocabulary and grammar rules, patience allows them to take the time needed to understand and practice these concepts. James 1:4 reminds us, \"Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.\" By practicing patience, students not only improve their Latin skills but also grow in character."

It reminds us of the importance of giving glory to God in all things, including our studies.
