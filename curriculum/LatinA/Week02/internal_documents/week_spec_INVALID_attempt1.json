First declension nouns typically end in '-a' in the nominative singular, which is the subject form of the noun. The chant for this week, 'a, ae, ae, am, ā', helps students memorize the endings for nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases respectively.\n\nUnderstanding these endings is crucial as they determine the noun's role in a sentence. For example, 'puella' means 'girl' in the nominative case, but 'puellam' in the accusative case indicates the girl is the object of the action. This builds on students' prior knowledge of simple Latin words and pronunciation, enhancing their ability to construct and comprehend basic Latin sentences."
