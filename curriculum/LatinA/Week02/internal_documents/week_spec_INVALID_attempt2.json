These nouns follow a specific pattern in the singular form: nominative ends in '-a', genitive in '-ae', dative in '-ae', accusative in '-am', and ablative in '-ā'.\n\nThe chant for this week is:\n```\na, ae, ae, am, ā\n```\nThis chant helps students memorize the endings and understand their grammatical functions. By practicing these endings, students will learn to identify and use first declension nouns correctly in sentences.\n\nBuilding on the previous week's introduction to Latin pronunciation, students will apply these skills to accurately pronounce and use new vocabulary. The focus will be on understanding the role of each case in a sentence, particularly distinguishing between the nominative and accusative cases."
