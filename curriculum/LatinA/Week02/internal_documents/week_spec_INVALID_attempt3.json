These endings correspond to the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases, respectively.\n\n```latin\nNominative: puella\nGenitive: puellae\nDative: puellae\nAccusative: puellam\nAblative: puellā\n```\n\nStudents will learn to distinguish between these cases through chants and practical examples. The chant `a, ae, ae, am, ā` will help reinforce the endings and their correct pronunciation.
