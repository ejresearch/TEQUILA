The first declension is essential for understanding Latin noun patterns and is predominantly feminine.\n\n#### Chant for First Declension Singular Endings:\n```\na, ae, ae, am, ā\n```\n\nThis chant helps students memorize the endings for the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases. By practicing these endings, students will be able to identify and use first declension nouns effectively in sentences. This builds on their prior knowledge of simple Latin words and pronunciation."
