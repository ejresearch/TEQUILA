# Latin A – Week 03 Day 1 : Exploring Plurality – Discovery

## Objective
Today, students will explore the concept of plurality in Latin, focusing on the formation and usage of plural nouns and verbs.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the singular forms of nouns and verbs, such as "puella" (girl) and "amo" (I love).
- Familiarity with basic Latin vocabulary and simple sentence structure has been established.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to plural noun and verb forms, understanding how to change singular to plural.
- Chant: A rhythmic chant to reinforce the new plural forms.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puellae (girls)
  - amici (friends)
  - libri (books)
  - equi (horses)
  - magistri (teachers)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of plurality reflects the virtue of community, emphasizing how individuals come together to form a collective. The faith phrase "Deus est cum nobis" (God is with us) reminds us of the divine presence in our communal gatherings.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice the pronunciation of plural endings, noting the differences from singular forms. Use the chant to help solidify their understanding and make the learning process engaging. Allow time for repetition and correction to ensure mastery of these new forms.
