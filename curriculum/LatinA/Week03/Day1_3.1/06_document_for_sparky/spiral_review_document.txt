Today's spiral review will focus on revisiting the vocabulary and grammar structures introduced in previous weeks. Specifically, we will review:

- Vocabulary: 'salve' (hello) and 'rosa' (rose), reinforcing their meanings and derivatives.
- Grammar: The singular forms of the first declension nouns, ensuring students are comfortable with 'puella, puellae, puellae, puellam, puellƒÅ'.
