## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Diligence** as we parse Latin nouns."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards: "puella", "rosa", "salve".
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: Think of a young girl.)
- Recycle grammar: "What are the singular endings for first declension?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the plural of 'puella'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job, keep going! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant: "-ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is" (slowly, then at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you chant the plural endings?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** Chanting plural endings, identifying plural forms, using vocabulary in sentences.

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, -ae sounds like 'ay'. Which case tells who/what does the action?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce plural forms using example sentence: "Puellae in horto ludunt."
- Parse together: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative.
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Using singular endings for plural nouns.
  - Correction cue: "Check the endings, remember our chant!"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do you say 'stars' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Try the sentence pattern A before B."

**Activity:**
- Present sentences: "Puellae in horto ludunt.", "Rosae pulchrae sunt."
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use color-coding for cases.
  - **Extension:** Add an adjective agreement task.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'Deo gratias' mean?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's be diligent like detectives finding clues in Latin words!"

**Faith Integration:**
"Use 'Deo gratias' as a cheerful closure after correct parsing."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "Deo gratias - Thanks be to God."

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Mispronouncing '-ae'
  **Correction Cue:** "Say it like 'ay', not 'ee'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use a visual chart of endings, pair with a buddy for chanting.
- **Extension:** Create sentences with new vocabulary, explore additional first declension nouns.

### Classroom Management
- Keep chants lively and quick.
- Transition smoothly between activities.
