# Latin A – Week 03 Day 3 : Review – Mastering First Declension Plurals

## Objective
Today, students will reinforce their understanding of the first declension plural endings in Latin, ensuring they can accurately identify and use these forms in translation and composition.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the singular forms of the first declension, focusing on endings such as -a, -ae, -am, and -ā.
- Familiarity with basic vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "terra" (land) will aid in recognizing and forming plurals.
- Understanding of noun cases, particularly nominative and accusative, is essential for today's focus.

## Focus for Today
- **Grammar:** Mastery of first declension plural endings (-ae, -ārum, -īs, -ās, -īs).
- **Chant:** Recitation of the first declension plural endings to reinforce memorization.
- **Vocabulary:**
  - puellae (girls)
  - terrae (lands)
  - aquae (waters)
  - viae (roads)
  - stellae (stars)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of diligence, encouraging students to carefully attend to the details of Latin endings. The faith phrase "Pax vobiscum" (Peace be with you) reminds students of the tranquility that comes with mastery and understanding.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant the plural endings rhythmically to aid memorization. Remind them to pay attention to pronunciation, particularly the long vowels in endings like -ārum and -īs. Allow time for practice with translating simple sentences using plural nouns to solidify their understanding.
