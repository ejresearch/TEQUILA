**First Declension Plural Chant**

Chant the endings for first declension plural nouns to the rhythm of a simple clap:

- Clap once: "-ae"
- Clap twice: "-ārum"
- Clap once: "-īs"
- Clap twice: "-ās"
- Clap once: "-īs"

Use hand motions to reinforce learning:
- Raise hands high for "-ae"
- Lower hands to waist for "-ārum"
- Extend arms forward for "-īs"
- Clap hands together for "-ās"
- Repeat motion for "-īs"

Encourage students to chant and move together to internalize the endings.
