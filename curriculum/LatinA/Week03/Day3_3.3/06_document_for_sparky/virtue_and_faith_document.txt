**Virtue and Faith Connection**

- **Virtue: Diligence**
  Diligence is the careful and persistent effort to accomplish a task. In our Latin studies, diligence is essential as we learn new vocabulary and grammar rules. Encourage students to apply diligence by practicing regularly and paying attention to detail.

- **Faith Phrase: Deo gratias**
  This phrase means 'Thanks be to God'. It is a reminder to express gratitude for the ability to learn and grow. Use this phrase to start or end class, fostering a sense of thankfulness.

- **Scripture Reference**: Colossians 3:23 - "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men." This verse emphasizes the importance of diligence in all our endeavors, including our studies.
