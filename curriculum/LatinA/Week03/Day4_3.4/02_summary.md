# Latin A – Week 03 Day 4 : Quiz – Mastering Plural Forms

## Objective
Today, students will demonstrate their understanding of Latin plural forms through a quiz, reinforcing their ability to identify and use plural nouns and verbs correctly.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the first and second declensions, which include singular and plural endings for nouns.
- Familiarity with basic Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "puer" (boy) is essential for forming plurals.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Mastery of plural forms in Latin nouns and verbs.
- Chant: Review chants that reinforce plural endings.
- Vocabulary: puellae, pueri, amicae, amici, libri, rosae, servi, deae

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of diligence, as students reflect on their progress and understanding of Latin plurals. The faith phrase "Deus amat omnes" (God loves all) reminds us of the inclusivity and unity in learning.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pace themselves during the quiz, focusing on accuracy over speed. Remind them to pronounce Latin words clearly, paying attention to the endings that indicate plural forms. This will aid in both their written and spoken Latin proficiency.
