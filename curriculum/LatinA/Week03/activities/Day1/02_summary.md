# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will begin their journey into Latin by learning about Latin nouns, focusing on their basic forms and functions. They will also be introduced to a chant that aids in memorizing noun endings.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously been introduced to the Latin alphabet, which will help them in pronouncing new vocabulary.
- Familiarity with basic Latin greetings and simple phrases will support their understanding of noun usage in sentences.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to Latin nouns, including their role in sentences and basic noun endings.
- Chant: A chant to help memorize the first declension noun endings.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella (girl)
  - agricola (farmer)
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - nauta (sailor)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin nouns encourages students to appreciate the structure and beauty of language, reflecting the virtue of diligence. The faith phrase "In principio erat Verbum" (In the beginning was the Word) reminds us of the power and importance of words.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to repeat the chant several times to internalize the noun endings. Remind them to focus on clear pronunciation, especially with vowel sounds, to build a strong foundation for future lessons.
