# Week 1 Day 2: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will deepen their understanding of Latin nouns by reviewing basic noun forms and practicing translation and recitation.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the Latin alphabet, which aids in pronunciation and spelling of Latin words.
- Familiarity with basic Latin vocabulary such as "aqua" (water) and "terra" (earth) supports noun recognition and usage.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to Latin noun declensions, focusing on the nominative case.
- Chant: Recitation of noun endings to reinforce memorization.
- Vocabulary: 
  - puella (girl)
  - servus (slave)
  - bellum (war)
  - agricola (farmer)
  - nauta (sailor)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of nouns encourages students to appreciate the structure and order in language, reflecting the virtue of diligence. The faith phrase, "Fides et Ratio" (Faith and Reason), reminds us that learning is a harmonious blend of belief and understanding.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice pronunciation by breaking down each word into syllables. Allow time for repetition of chants to solidify understanding of noun endings. Reinforce the connection between Latin and English derivatives to enhance vocabulary retention.
