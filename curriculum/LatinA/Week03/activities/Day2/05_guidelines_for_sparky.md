# Week 1 Day 2: Class: Week 1 Day 2

## Objectives & Success Criteria
### Objectives
- Identify first declension noun endings.
- Recite the first declension chant.
- Translate simple sentences using first declension nouns.

### Success Criteria
- Students correctly identify noun endings.
- Students recite the chant from memory.
- Students translate simple sentences accurately.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (vocabulary_spiral + new vocab)
- Parsing worksheet (cases, numbers)
- Whiteboard and markers

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, class! Today we'll practice **Patience** as we learn new Latin endings. Let's start by reviewing some words we know."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral: "puella", "schola", "mensa", "liber", "aqua".
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: It's someone in the garden!)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "Who remembers what a noun is?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the nominative singular ending for 'puella'?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job remembering the endings! Let's try that chant together. We'll do it slowly first, then with some rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant: "-a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā; -ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is."
- Students echo the chant.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the first declension chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** First declension noun endings, simple sentence translation

**Sparky says:**
"Let's look at how these endings work in sentences. Which case tells us who or what does the action?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: Nominative case for subjects.
- Show example sentence: "Puella est in horto."
- Parse together: "Puella" (nominative singular).
- Highlight common misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Incorrect noun ending
  - Correction cue: "Check the noun's role in the sentence."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What does 'schola' mean in English?"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's practice with some sentences. Remember, patience helps us learn!"

**Activity:**
- Present sentences: "Mensa est in aula.", "Liber est in mensa."
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding.
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for noun endings.
  - **Extension:** Challenge students to create their own sentences.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "How do we say 'table' in Latin?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's practice patience as we learn new endings and words today! Notice each ending carefully; steady effort makes clear Latin."

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's say 'Gloria Patri' together to end our lesson."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri."

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Incorrect noun ending
  **Correction Cue:** "Check the noun's role in the sentence."
- **Pattern:** Mispronouncing 'puella'
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember, it's 'pweh-lah'."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for noun endings, provide sentence starters for translations.
- **Extension:** Challenge students to create their own sentences, introduce additional vocabulary from the list.

### Classroom Management
- Keep transitions smooth with clear signals.
- Use a timer for chant practice.
- Encourage participation with positive reinforcement.
