# Week 1 Day 3: Week 1 Day 3

## Objectives & Success Criteria
### Objectives
- Identify first declension noun endings in Latin.
- Recite the first declension chant accurately.
- Translate simple sentences using first declension nouns.

### Success Criteria
- Students can chant the endings correctly.
- Students translate simple sentences accurately.
- Students identify noun endings in context.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (vocabulary_spiral + new vocab)
- Parsing worksheet (cases, numbers)
- Visual aids for noun endings

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē! Today we'll practice **Patience** as we parse Latin nouns."

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral: "puella," "schola," "mensa," "liber," "aqua."
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: It's someone in our class!)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "Who can find the noun in this sentence?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the ending for singular nominative?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job remembering the endings! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo)
- Students echo
- Point to endings as they chant

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you chant the first declension endings?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** First declension noun endings, simple sentence translation

**Sparky says:**
"Which case tells who/what does the action?"

**Activity:**
- Introduce grammar concept: First declension endings (-a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā)
- Show example sentence: "Puella est in horto."
- Parse together (case, number)
- Highlight common_misconceptions:
  - Pattern: Confusing noun endings
  - Correction cue: "Remember: -a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā for singular."

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Translate: 'Puella est in horto.'"

---

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Try the sentence pattern A before B."

**Activity:**
- Present 3–5 practice sentences
- Students parse/translate with scaffolding
- Differentiation:
  - **Support:** Use visual aids for noun endings.
  - **Extension:** Challenge with additional sentences to translate.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Which noun is in this sentence?"

---

### Phase 5: Closure & Virtue Tie-In (2–3 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Let's practice patience by taking our time to learn each noun ending."

**Faith Integration:**
"Let's say 'Gloria Patri' to refocus."

**Activity:**
- Review objectives
- Students self-assess against success_criteria
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri"

---

## Coaching Notes
### Common Misconceptions
- **Pattern:** Confusing noun endings
  **Correction Cue:** "Remember: -a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā for singular."

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Support:** Use visual aids for noun endings. Provide sentence frames for translations.
- **Extension:** Challenge with additional sentences to translate. Explore more complex sentences using new vocabulary.

### Classroom Management
- Use hand signals for quiet transitions.
- Set a timer for chant practice.
