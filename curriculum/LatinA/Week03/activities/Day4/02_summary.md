# Week 1 Day 4: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will be assessed on their understanding of Latin nouns, focusing on identifying and translating basic nouns from Latin to English and vice versa.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about the Latin alphabet, which helps in pronouncing and recognizing Latin words.
- Basic vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water) has been introduced, providing a foundation for noun recognition.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Review of Latin noun endings and their role in sentence structure.
- Chant: Reinforce noun declension patterns through rhythmic repetition.
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, agricola, nauta, poeta, via, villa

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin nouns encourages precision and clarity in communication, reflecting the virtue of diligence. The faith phrase "Fides et Veritas" (Faith and Truth) reminds us of the importance of truth in language.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pronounce each noun clearly, focusing on the endings that indicate their grammatical role. Allow time for reflection on quiz results to guide future learning.
