### Success Criteria
- Students recite the chant correctly.
- Students identify noun endings in sentences.
- Students translate simple sentences accurately.

## Materials & Setup
- Chant chart (from WeekSpec)
- Flashcards (vocabulary_spiral + new vocab)
- Parsing worksheet (cases, numbers)
- Visual aids for noun endings

## Minute-by-Minute Flow

### Phase 1: Greeting & Spiral Review (5 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Salvē, amici! Today we'll practice **Patience** as we learn Latin. Remember, learning takes time, and that's okay!"

**Activity:**
- Show flashcards from vocabulary_spiral: "puella", "schola", "mensa", "liber", "aqua".
- Ask: "What does 'puella' mean?" (Hint: It's someone in a garden!)
- Recycle grammar_spiral: "Who remembers what a noun is?"

**Check for Understanding:**
- "What is the ending for nominative singular?"

---

### Phase 2: Chant Introduction/Practice (5–7 min)
**Sparky says:**
"Great job, keep trying! Let's chant it once slowly, then once with rhythm."

**Activity:**
- Display chant chart.
- Model chant (once slowly, once at tempo).
- Students echo.
- Point to endings as they chant.

**Check for Understanding:**
- "Can you recite the chant?"

---

### Phase 3: Grammar Instruction (8–10 min)
**Focus:** First declension noun endings

**Sparky says:**
"Remember, endings are important! Which case tells who/what does the action?"

**Activity:**

- Show example sentence: "Puella est in horto."
- Parse together: Identify case and number.
- Highlight common_misconceptions:

### Phase 4: Guided Practice (5–7 min)

**Activity:**
- Review objectives.
- Students self-assess against success_criteria.
- Close with faith phrase: "Gloria Patri."
