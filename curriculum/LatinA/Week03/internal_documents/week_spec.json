In Latin, first declension nouns typically end in '-a' in the singular and are mostly feminine. The plural forms use the endings '-ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is'.\n\nTo help students remember these endings, we use the chant:\n\n```\n-ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is\n```\n\nWe begin by reviewing the singular forms to ensure a solid foundation, then move to the plural. Visual aids and repetitive chanting are key strategies to help students differentiate between singular and plural endings. By understanding these endings, students can form and translate simple sentences, enhancing their grasp of Latin grammar."

Use color-coding to highlight the endings.\n- For advanced students, introduce additional vocabulary from the 1st declension and have them create complex sentences.\n\n**Materials Needed:**\n- Week Paradigm Chart\n- Flashcard Sets for New and Review Vocabulary\n\n**Connections:**\n- This week builds on the singular forms learned in Week 2 and prepares students for more complex sentence structures."
