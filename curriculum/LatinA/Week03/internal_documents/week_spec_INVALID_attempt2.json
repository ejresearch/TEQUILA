These endings correspond to the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative cases, respectively. Here is the chant to help memorize these endings:\n\n```\n-ae, -arum, -is, -as, -is\n```\n\nBy practicing this chant, students will reinforce their understanding of how to transform singular nouns into their plural forms, building on their knowledge of the nominative singular learned in previous weeks."
