Sparky begins Week 11 by recalling *sum, esse* (“to be”) and the subject-verb pattern learned earlier.
Students now meet the **First Conjugation (–āre)** verbs and chant endings showing person and number.
Familiar nouns such as *puella*, *puer*, *rosa*, and *aqua* appear again, tying new verbs to old vocabulary.
The virtue **Diligentia – Diligence** and faith phrase **Deus nos amat – God loves us** connect careful practice with worshipful attention.
Tomorrow they’ll strengthen accuracy and discover English derivatives from these verbs.
