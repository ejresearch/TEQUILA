Sparky begins Week 13 by showing how nouns and verbs work together to make complete Latin thoughts.
Students revisit old friends (puella, puer, Deus) and combine them with verbs they already know—amat, videt, habet—to form Pattern A sentences.
They chant, translate, and parse each word’s role, discovering that every complete Latin sentence tells a small truth.
The virtue Veritas – Truth reminds learners that right seeing and right saying belong together.
