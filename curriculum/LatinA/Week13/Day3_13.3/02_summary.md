Sparky guides students through Sentence Patterns C and D — linking verbs (est) and indirect objects (servō, puellae).
They learn that Pattern C describes what is true about the subject (Deus est bonus – God is good), and Pattern D shows who receives something (Dominus servō donum dat – The lord gives a gift to the servant).
By combining all four patterns, students now read and write full Latin thoughts.
The virtue Veritas – Truth reminds them to speak what is true and give what is due.
