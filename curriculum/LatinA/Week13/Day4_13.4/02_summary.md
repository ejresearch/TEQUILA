Sparky closes Week 13 with a joyful review of all four sentence patterns.
Students chant, translate, and parse A through D, then take a brief oral quiz.
They review case endings (-a/-us → -am/-um → -ae/-ō), verb agreement, and meaning.
Finally, Sparky invites reflection: truthful speech joins seeing, knowing, and giving rightly.
This day seals the virtue Veritas – Truth before Week 14 begins the new verb system.
