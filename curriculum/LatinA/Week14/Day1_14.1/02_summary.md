Sparky begins a new two-week study of prepositions — small words that show direction and position.
Today’s focus is prepositions that take the accusative case to show motion toward something.
Students revisit familiar nouns and verbs of movement, learning phrases like ad puellam (“to the girl”) and in agrum (“into the field”).
The virtue Ordō – Order teaches that right direction brings harmony — both in grammar and in life.
