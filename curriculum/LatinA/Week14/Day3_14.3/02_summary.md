Sparky now helps students weave prepositional phrases into full sentences that show direction, purpose, and order.
They act out Latin sentences (Puella currit ad domum; Puer portat aquam per viam) and create short translation stories.
By recognizing how ad, in, per, super, ante organize ideas, students see that order in Latin mirrors order in creation.
Virtue focus: Ordō – Order, “Right steps in right places.”
