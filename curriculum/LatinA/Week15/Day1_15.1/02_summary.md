This week Sparky guides students from motion to rest.
Where last week’s prepositions showed direction, today’s show location and companionship.
Students meet the Ablative Case, marked by endings –ā and –ō, used after prepositions like in, sub, cum, ē/ex, dē.
They learn that in hortō means “in the garden,” cum amīcō means “with a friend,” and sub arbore means “under the tree.”
The virtue Pax – Peace shows that rest comes after right order.
