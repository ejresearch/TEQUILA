# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to basic Latin vocabulary related to nature and ecosystems, focusing on nouns and simple sentence structures.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the Latin alphabet, which will aid in pronunciation and spelling.
- Familiarity with basic Latin greetings and common phrases will support understanding of sentence formation.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to Latin nouns and their singular forms.
- Chant: A simple chant to reinforce pronunciation of new vocabulary.
- Vocabulary: 
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - arbor (tree)
  - flumen (river)
  - caelum (sky)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study encourages appreciation of the natural world, reflecting the virtue of gratitude. The faith phrase "Deus creavit" (God created) ties into our exploration of nature's Latin vocabulary.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice pronunciation by repeating each word after you. Use the chant to create a rhythmic learning experience, helping students remember the vocabulary. Allow time for students to form simple sentences using "aqua" and "terra" to describe their surroundings.
