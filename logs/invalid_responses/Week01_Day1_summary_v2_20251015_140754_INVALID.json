# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to foundational Latin vocabulary and grammar, focusing on basic noun forms and their meanings.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the Latin alphabet, which will aid in pronunciation and spelling.
- Familiarity with basic Latin greetings and simple phrases will support understanding of new vocabulary.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to first declension nouns.
- Chant: A simple chant to reinforce noun endings.
- Vocabulary: 
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - puella (girl)
  - nauta (sailor)
  - agricola (farmer)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Todayâ€™s virtue is perseverance, encouraging students to persist in learning Latin. The faith phrase "Fides et Veritas" (Faith and Truth) reminds us of the importance of truth in language learning.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to repeat the chant multiple times to internalize noun endings. Remind them to pronounce each vowel clearly, as Latin is a phonetic language. Allow time for students to practice writing and saying each new vocabulary word.
