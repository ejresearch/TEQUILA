# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will begin their journey into Latin by learning basic vocabulary related to nature and the environment, setting the foundation for understanding Latin's role in describing the natural world.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the Latin alphabet, which will aid in pronunciation and spelling of new vocabulary.
- Basic Latin greetings and introductions have been covered, providing familiarity with simple sentence structures.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to simple noun and verb forms.
- Chant: A rhythmic chant to help memorize new vocabulary.
- Vocabulary: 
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - arbor (tree)
  - caelum (sky)
  - flumen (river)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
As we explore the Latin language, we reflect on the virtue of curiosity, encouraging students to explore the world around them with wonder. The faith phrase "In principio creavit Deus caelum et terram" (In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth) ties into our vocabulary focus on elements of nature.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to pronounce each Latin word slowly, focusing on vowel sounds. Use the chant to reinforce vocabulary retention. Allow time for students to practice writing each word, connecting sounds to letters.
