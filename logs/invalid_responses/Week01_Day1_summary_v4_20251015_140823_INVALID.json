# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will be introduced to foundational Latin vocabulary and basic grammar structures, setting the stage for understanding more complex sentences in future lessons.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned the Latin alphabet, which will aid in pronunciation and spelling of new vocabulary.
- Familiarity with basic Latin greetings and common phrases will help in understanding sentence structure.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to simple Latin sentence structure, focusing on subject-verb-object order.
- Chant: A simple chant to reinforce pronunciation and rhythm in Latin.
- Vocabulary: 
  - aqua (water)
  - terra (earth)
  - caelum (sky)
  - arbor (tree)
  - flumen (river)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's virtue focuses on curiosity, encouraging students to explore the Latin language with enthusiasm. The faith phrase "Fides et Scientia" (Faith and Knowledge) reminds us that learning is a journey of both heart and mind.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to repeat the vocabulary aloud to practice pronunciation. Spend time on the chant to help students internalize the rhythm of Latin. Allow students to explore the connections between Latin words and their English derivatives, fostering a deeper understanding of language roots.
