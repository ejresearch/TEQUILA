- Basic understanding of Latin noun cases, particularly the nominative and accusative.

## Focus for Today

  - aqua (water)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of curiosity, encouraging students to explore the Latin language with wonder. The faith phrase "In principio erat Verbum" (In the beginning was the Word) highlights the power of language in understanding the world.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice pronunciation by repeating the vocabulary words aloud, focusing on the long and short vowel sounds. Use the chant to reinforce the noun endings, helping students internalize these foundational elements. Aim for a balance between new content and review to build confidence and competence.
