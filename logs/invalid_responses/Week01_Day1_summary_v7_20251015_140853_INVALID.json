# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to Ecosystems

## Objective
Today, students will begin their journey into Latin by learning foundational vocabulary and basic grammar structures, setting the stage for understanding more complex sentences.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously encountered basic Latin greetings and common classroom phrases.
- Familiarity with the Latin alphabet and its pronunciation.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to simple noun declensions, focusing on nominative and accusative cases.
- Chant: A rhythmic chant to memorize the first declension endings.
- Vocabulary: 
  - terra (earth)
  - aqua (water)
  - silva (forest)
  - caelum (sky)
  - flumen (river)

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's lesson emphasizes the virtue of curiosity, encouraging students to explore the Latin language with an open mind. The faith phrase "In principio erat Verbum" (In the beginning was the Word) highlights the power of language in shaping understanding.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to practice pronunciation by repeating the vocabulary aloud, focusing on the vowel sounds. Use the chant to reinforce the declension endings, and remind students that Latin is a language of patterns and structure, which will become clearer with practice.
