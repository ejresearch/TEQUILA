# Week 1 Day 4: Introduction to Latin Nouns

## Objective
Today, students will deepen their understanding of Latin nouns, focusing on their forms and functions within sentences. They will also reflect on their progress through a quiz.

## Prior Knowledge
- Students have previously learned about the basic structure of Latin sentences, including subject-verb-object order.
- Familiarity with Latin vocabulary such as "puella" (girl) and "aqua" (water) will aid in understanding noun usage.

## Focus for Today
- Grammar: Introduction to the concept of declensions in Latin nouns.
- Chant: Reinforce noun endings through rhythmic repetition.
- Vocabulary: puella, aqua, terra, agricola, nauta, poeta, silva, via

## Virtue & Faith Connection
Today's study of Latin nouns encourages precision and clarity in communication, reflecting the virtue of diligence. The faith phrase "Fides et Ratio" (Faith and Reason) reminds us that language learning is a harmonious blend of belief and logic.

## Teacher Notes
Encourage students to chant noun endings to internalize declensions. Remind them to pronounce vowels clearly, as Latin is a phonetic language. Allow time for reflection on the quiz to identify areas of strength and improvement.
